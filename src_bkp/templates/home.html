One can choose Scala or Python as coding language, for this exam. It is not required to know both Scala and Python. Knowing any one of them is good enough. In the exam the final output will be asked to be saved in a particular location, or in any table. Only this final output file data, or target table data would be evaluated. Code to generate the final output will not be evaluated, or asked to be saved anywhere. Only official reference documentation associated with various technologies like Sqoop, Spark, Flume, Hive etc can be accessed during the exam. For full list of documentation, please visit http://www.cloudera.com/more/training/certification/cca-spark.html.

Data Ingestion includes 1. import/export and other scenarios using Sqoop and Mysql. 2. Moving Data in and out of HDFS using Hadoop fs commands. Transform, Stage and Store includes 1. load data from HDFS and store results back to HDFS using Spark. 2. Perform transformations and actions like join, filter, aggregation, sort, etc using Spark. 3. Dealing with various data structures like Parquet, Json, Avro, Orc, etc and compression techniques like gzip, snappy, etc. While Data Analysis includes 1. Metastore (Hive Tables) creation and analysis. 2. Evolving an Avro schema and creating metastore table based on Avro Schema. 3. Using Spark SQL or Data Frames to achieve business scenario."],
